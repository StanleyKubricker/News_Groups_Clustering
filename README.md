Dataset available from https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html

This code retrieves and prepares the dataset, uses Singular Value Decomposition to reduce dimensionality, automatically selects the optimal number of clusters (based on evaluation metrics) and peforms clustering before displaying the outputs for interpretation.
